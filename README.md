# petition

This is the first project I completed during the coding bootcamp I attended in Q1 2021. It is a petition app providing authentication, signature capture via Canvas, and simple searches in the list of signers.

The petition protests the harvesting of horseshoe crab blood.

Back end: Express, Handlebars, PostgresSQL, Redis.
Front end: Canvas API.
