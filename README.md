# petition

This is the first project from my coding bootcamp. It is a petition app providing authentication, signature capture via Canvas, and simple searches in the list of signers.

The petition protests the harvesting of horseshoe crab blood.

Back end: Express, Handlebars, PostgresSQL, Redis
Front end: Canvas API

Deployed on March 21, 2021 on Heroku: https://save-the-crabs.herokuapp.com/.
